üßÆ My Simple Calculator ‚Äì calculator.py

This is a minimal Python script that performs basic arithmetic operations using two user inputs. It is designed to demonstrate foundational Python syntax, control flow, and user interaction.


---

üõ† Purpose

The script serves as a basic calculator that takes two numerical inputs from the user and an operator (like +, -, *, or /) to compute a result. It‚Äôs an excellent example for beginners to understand how Python handles user input, conditional logic, and output.

üß± Structure Overview

The program follows a clear top-to-bottom procedural structure:

1. User Input Section
The script begins by prompting the user to enter two values and a mathematical operator. These inputs are typically converted into numerical types suitable for arithmetic.


2. Control Flow with Conditional Statements
The core logic uses a chain of if, elif, and else statements to evaluate which operation was requested. Based on the operator input, the corresponding mathematical operation is performed.


3. Error Handling (Optional)
A check is often included to prevent issues like division by zero. This shows how basic input validation can be handled using conditional logic.


4. Output Section
The result of the calculation is displayed to the user using a simple print statement, demonstrating standard output in Python.

üîç Key Python Concepts Used

Input Handling
The script uses built-in functions to receive user input from the command line. This illustrates how to interactively collect data during runtime.

Type Conversion
Since inputs from the user are strings by default, explicit type casting (e.g. converting strings to numbers) is necessary to perform mathematical operations.

Conditional Logic
The decision-making part of the script uses conditional statements to determine which operation to perform. This is a core aspect of control flow in Python.

Basic Arithmetic Operators
Standard math operators (+, -, *, /) are used to perform calculations.

Output Display
The result is shown using simple console output, demonstrating how Python displays information to the user.

üöÄ Getting Started

To run the script:

1. Make sure you have Python 3 installed.


2. Run the script from your terminal or command prompt:

python calculator.py


3. Follow the prompts to input numbers and an operator.
